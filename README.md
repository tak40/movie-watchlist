## Overview
This project is a part of Scrimba's Frontend Career Path, with a focus on Module 8: Working with APIs. It's designed to strengthen understanding of APIs and persistent data storage in web applications. 

## Key Learnings
- **APIs**: Central to this project was harnessing the power of APIs, specifically the OMDB API. The aim was to practice fetching, handling, and displaying data from an external source.
- **LocalStorage**: As an important web storage solution, the project allowed for the implementation of LocalStorage for saving and retrieving user-specific data (watchlisted movies in this case).
- **JavaScript Refactoring**: The journey also emphasized clean, modular, and maintainable JavaScript code. Through iterative development, we refactored the scripts to ensure efficiency and readability.
  
## Requirements
This is a solo project provided by Scrimba. The primary guidelines are illustrated below:

Key Features:
- **Build from scratch**
- **Two pages**: `index.html` and `watchlist.html`.
  - `Index`: Search page. Calls the OMDB API using the title searched and displays the results.
  - Button functionality to "add to watchlist", saving the movie data to local storage.
  - `Watchlist.html`: Loads and displays movies from local storage.

## Design Mockups

## Development Focus
- **Accessibility Priority**: A strong emphasis was placed on ensuring the application was accessible, catering to a broad range of users.
- **Mobile-First Approach**: The design and development phases prioritized mobile users, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

## Personal Stretch Goals
- **Focus on Accessibility**: Aimed to make the application as inclusive as possible.
- **CSS Refactor**: Implemented CSS Variables and the BEM naming convention for better maintainability and scalability.
- **UI/UX Improvement**: Prioritized an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
